All my life I have enjoyed cycling. Since I've been living in Switzerland, unfortunately not so often, because with all the mountains it can be very, very exhausting, especially since I'm not exactly a lightweight. So I bought an S-Pedelec in spring 2018 and have been on the road more since then than ever before: 7'355 km / 4'570 mi in one year!

After several day and weekend tours I drove in August 2018 from Lucerne in Switzerland through Germany to Padborg in Denmark, that was over 1'100 km in seven and a half days. When I took part in a conference in March 2019, I decided to travel by bicycle. From Lucerne in Switzerland via France (Alsace and Northern Vosges) to Cologne and back, that was 1'332 km / 828 mi in eight days.

Since I'm planning much more (about 2'500 km / 1'550 mi from Lucerne to Barcelona and back and about 8'000 km / 5'000 mi through the USA) and my friends are always asking me, I want to write about it in this blog and experiment with GPS trackers and video reports. Let's see what will happenâ€¦
