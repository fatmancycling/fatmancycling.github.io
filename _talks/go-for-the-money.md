title: Go for the Money! JSR-354
permalink: /Go-for-the-Money/
---

**In the last years the development of the Java language itself is going on more rapidly and some long-awaited features were implemented. The best-known are the new *Date & Time API* and *Lambdas & Streams*. Specially for business applications there was another very interesting feature released in May 2015: JSR-354 â€“ Money and Currency API**

What is this JSR about, why is there a need for a Money and Currency API? After answering these questions I provide an overview about the new API, their packages and classes with usage examples. I show how to calculate with money objects, how to convert between currencies, how to format and how to parse values using the Money and Currency API.

The Money and Currency API is compatible with Java 8 and planned to be delivered as a part of Java SE 9 which is scheduled to be released in summer 2017. At the end of my talk there is a demonstration, where I show how an application can use the new Money and Currency API in practice. To fully understand this talk the attendees should have basic knowledge of Java.
