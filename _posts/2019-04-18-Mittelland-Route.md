Every year Easter is a good opportunity to go on a trip lasting several days. Four days off in a row and this year with great weather, sunshine and pleasantly warm temperatures. It's no wonder I won't miss this opportunity! This year I have decided on the Mittelland route, the national cycle route 5 from Romanshorn on Lake Constance to Lausanne on Lake Geneva. According to the plan, it is about 375 km, a pleasant distance for four days. For the three nights, I reserved the hotels in advance. So let's go!
