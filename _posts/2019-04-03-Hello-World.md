Welcome to the first post of my new blog! For a long time I was pregnant with the thought, now a new blog was born.  If you want to know more about who I am and why I created this blog, please have a look at the [about me](/about) page. Since this blog is about my trips and travels with my bicycle and the cycling season is about to start, I promise that real content will be added very quickly.

Yours  
Marcus
