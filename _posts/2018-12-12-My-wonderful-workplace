There's a table in my office. It's just for me. Underneath is a workstation. It is only for me. Only there can I work, at this one place. If something disturbs me there, for example colleagues on the phone while I have to concentrate, I can't go somewhere else. In my role as an agile coach for a large company, I take part in many meetings. Even then, I can't take my workstation with me to access documents and take notes. You want to be agile, but all the tools are very static. I think that's stupid.

But what do I want? How do I imagine my own wonderful device? I want more flexibility. If I need special concentration for something, I want to be able to retreat somewhere. On the other hand, I would like to work out a solution together with one or the other colleague. I want to have my documents and notes with me everywhere, even at meetings.

Today, at the end of 2018, these are no longer special requirements. It's not a wishful thinking concert, it should be standard in all office jobs. Fortunately, this is already the case in many companies, but unfortunately not in everyone and, a pity in particular, not with my employer. He has been evaluating virtualized developer PCs running on a server within VMs for several months now. This would at least allow me to move to another workplace. But that was it with the flexibility, my other requirements can not meet even the virtualized PC.

I need something that Alan Kay designed as a concept for Xerox PARC back in 1972: The Dynabook! Today we would say notebook. It's time for this device to find its way to my employer after almost fifty years. I want to close it at my workplace, go to a colleague, open it up and discuss a solution together. I want to open it up in a meeting and take notes and access documents. I want to retreat to a quiet place where I can concentrate on my development. I want to take it home with me for homework and also use it for external meetings.

Yes, I want a notebook. No workstation. No virtualized system. A notebook. I don't mind "bring your own device", I wouldn't have a problem with that. But unfortunately I can't access company data with my notebook. Too bad. With my next employer, I will make sure that I can not only work effectively but also efficiently.

This is a large part of what I call "my wonderful workplace". There's more to it than that, but the actual work device is essential.
