When I ride longer tours, I often use the mobile app of [LocaToWeb](https://locatoweb.com/user/mcpringle) and display my current position on this page. You can then follow me live here, send me messages and look at my photos right after I took them.

## Actual live broadcast event

After crossing the Atlantic Ocean by ship at the beginning of August, I am crossing the USA with my bicycle since mid-August. The trip will take about three months and more information can be found [in an own blog article](/en/2019/07/30/Sabbatical-2019-USA/).

During this live broadcast, there are exceptionally no photos on LocaToWeb, as the Tracker app runs alone on a separate smartphone and is in my pocket. I link my photos under my daily reports in my running blog, unfortunately with some delay because I don't have time to write every day.
