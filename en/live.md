When I ride longer tours, I often use the mobile app of [LocaToWeb](https://locatoweb.com/user/mcpringle) and display my current position on this page. You can then follow me live here, send me messages and look at my photos right after I took them.

## Actual live broadcast event

Currently, there is no live broadcast. The next trip with live broadcasting starts in mid August 2019 and will be linked here. Actually, the trip starts already on August 1st with an Atlantic crossing by ship from Antwerp (Belgium) to Philadelphia (USA), but during the crossing I have no Internet to update my position. The cycle tour starts at the east coast in Philadelphia and goas via Chicago (following the old Route 66) to Los Angeles. It will take about three months.
