When I ride longer tours, I often use the mobile app of [LocaToWeb](https://locatoweb.com/user/mcpringle) and display my current position on this page. You can then follow me live here, send me messages and look at my photos right after I took them.

## Actual live broadcast event

In mid-August 2019 I will start my three-month crossing of the USA from the east coast to the west coast. To get to the USA at all, I cross the Atlantic this time in a cargo ship, the Independent Horizon. I record the crossing again and also try a live tracking, but I can't promise anything in the middle of the Atlantic. Just click on the big icon and keep your fingers crossed that it works...
