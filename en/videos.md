I am experimenting with recording and cutting videos about my travels. Actually, they are in German but I will see how I can add English subtitles. For publishing my videos I use YouTube and Vimeo. The videos on both platforms are identical so you can choose the platform based on your own preference.

Feedback is highly appreciated!
