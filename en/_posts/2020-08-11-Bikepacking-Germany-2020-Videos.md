As soon as I was back home again after my trip to Germany, I set out to review the contents of my memory cards and edit the first videos from the recordings with my mental effusions. The result can now be found in [my channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVPiWk3TEQtNnuRFmYnafyw). Two videos about the first two days have already been published, more videos are in the pipeline and will follow. Please subscribe to [my channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVPiWk3TEQtNnuRFmYnafyw) and don't forget to click on the bell to be notified when new videos appear.

Have fun watching, and I'm looking forward to your likes, comments and feedback!

Yours  
Marcus
