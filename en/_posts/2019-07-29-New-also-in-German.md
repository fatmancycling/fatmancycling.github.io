Good news! I was often asked, now it is available: Newly there are articles on my bicycle blog also in German! From now on I will publish all new articles in two languages at the same time: English and German. Old articles, which were only available in English, will not be translated into German for the time being. But all new articles will now also be available in German.

When you open the [homepage](/), the language is automatically recognized and you get the articles displayed in your language. At the bottom of the page you can also have the article displayed in the other language, if available. I hope you enjoy it and I'm looking forward to your feedback!

Yours  
Marcus
