For a long time I was looking forward to the [Lake Constance Cycling Marathon](https://bodensee-radmarathon.ch/), because so many events have been cancelled this year and due to the long time decreasing number of cases of Covid-19 I was very confident. Unfortunately, the Lake Constance Cycling Marathon 2020 had to be cancelled, too. Understandable, but a pity, because I wanted to take the gold tour with 220 km. I have never managed so many kilometres in one day before. However, the planning for the Lake Constance Cycling Marathon 2021 is already underway. Save the date: September 11, 2021

Yours  
Marcus
