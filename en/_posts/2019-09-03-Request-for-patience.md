Hello dear readers! I'm fantastic and I'm still on my [bike tour through the USA](/en/2019/07/30/Sabbatical-2019-USA/). However, I take much more time to enjoy than to write, so my travel reports here in my blog are not as up to date as I would like them to be and appear much delayed. Please forgive me -- enjoying my time out to the fullest is my top priority. But I promise you that all travelogues will appear here bit by bit. Just a little later.

Yours  
Marcus
