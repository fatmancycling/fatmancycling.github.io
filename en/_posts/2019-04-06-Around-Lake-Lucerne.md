Saturday. The sun is shining. So what could be more obvious than to use the day off for a ride? I started relatively late, it was a Saturday after all. The weather was great, a lot of sun, even if it wasn't very warm. In addition a nice trip with the ferry over the mirror-smooth lake and in Weggis I enjoyed a delicious Bratwurst directly at the lake on a bench in the sun. It was a very nice tour, from which I created a small video with Relive. The recording of the GPX data is available, as always, on Komoot, including some photos.

Yours
