When I ride longer tours, I often use the mobile app of [LocaToWeb](https://locatoweb.com/user/mcpringle) and display my current position on this page. You can then follow me live here, send me messages and look at my photos right after I took them.

My next ride with live broadcast will be on Friday, April 12th. From Lucerne I will drive through the Entlebuch Biosphere to Lake Thun to take part in the annual exam of the Java User Group Switzerland. After the retreat on Saturday I will drive only a short distance to one of my favorite hotels in Wilderswil and then on Sunday, April 14th over the Br√ºnigpass back to Lucerne.
