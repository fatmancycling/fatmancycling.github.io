When I ride longer tours, I often use the mobile app of [LocaToWeb](https://locatoweb.com/user/mcpringle) and display my current position on this page. You can then follow me live here, send me messages and look at my photos right after I took them.

## Actual live broadcast event

Currently, there is no live broadcast. The next trip with live broadcasting starts in mid August 2019 and will be linked here. The journey will follow the old Route 66 from Chicago to Los Angeles and continue to San Francisco.
