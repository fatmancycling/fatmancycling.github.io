When I ride longer tours, I often use the mobile app of [LocaToWeb](https://locatoweb.com/user/mcpringle) and display my current position on this page. You can then follow me live here, send me messages and look at my photos right after I took them.

## Actual live broadcast event

Over Easter from 19 to 22 April four days from Romanshorn on Lake Constance to Lausanne on Lake Geneva via the national cycle route No. 5, Mittelland Route. (375 km / 233 mi)
